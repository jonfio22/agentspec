## Directory Overview

This directory contains a prototype for a web application called "AgentSpec". AgentSpec is a prompt generator for creating AI agents. It provides a user-friendly, step-by-step process for designing AI agents and teams of agents, and then generates a detailed prompt that can be used with a large language model (LLM) to generate the agent code.
