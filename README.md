# AgentSpec

AgentSpec is a web-based tool for designing and generating prompts for AI agents. It provides a user-friendly, step-by-step process for designing AI agents and teams of agents, and then generates a detailed prompt that can be used with a large language model (LLM) to generate the agent code.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Follow the on-screen instructions to design your AI agent or team of agents.
3.  When you're finished, the application will generate a detailed prompt for you.
4.  Copy the prompt and paste it into your favorite LLM to generate the agent code.

## Future Development

This is currently a prototype. In the future, we plan to add the following features:

*   Export options for different formats, such as JSON (for n8n) and markdown.
*   Advanced customization options for fine-tuning the generated prompts.
*   A library of prompt templates for different use cases.
